Please make sure to backup your IPF files before decrypting them.  \r\n\r\n- Before decrypting the IPF, please make sure your IPF isn't opened in IPF Suite, and close the game (no Client_tos.exe process in the background).\r\n\r\n- If it doesn't appear to work correctly, check if you're opening the correct IPF in IPF Suite. It happened to me multiple times to mix up the IPFs thinking I was in the correct folder :blush:.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce decrypted, the IPF is readable by traditional tools (such as IPF Suite).  \r\n\r\n![HowTo](http://i.imgur.com/NfEJ9Ma.gif)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
